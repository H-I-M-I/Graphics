# Graphics Lab Work

This repository contains implementations of fundamental computer graphics algorithms in C++ without using built-in graphics functions. The programs use low-level graphics programming to demonstrate basic drawing and clipping techniques.

## List of Implemented Algorithms

### **Line Drawing Algorithms**
- Direct Line Equation
- Bresenham's Line Algorithm
- Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Algorithm
- **Comparison:** Time complexity analysis of each algorithm.

### **Circle Drawing Algorithms**
- Bresenham's Circle Algorithm
- Midpoint Circle Algorithm
- **Comparison:** Time complexity analysis of each algorithm.

### **Ellipse Drawing**
- Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm

### **Clipping Algorithms**
- Line Clipping Algorithm (Cohen-Sutherland, Liang-Barsky)
- Polygon Clipping Algorithm (Sutherland-Hodgman)

## Features
- Implemented from scratch using C++
- Uses the **graphics.h** library for rendering
- No built-in graphics functions are used for drawing primitives
- Efficient execution with a focus on algorithmic understanding
